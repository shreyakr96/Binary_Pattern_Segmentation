# Binary_Pattern_Segmentation
This project uses local binary pattern based segmentation to extract an object of a certain texture, from its background.
This is particularly used when the background is of a similar texture yo the object, in terms of the grey level intensity histograms.

Details of how the functions can be used are found in the attached report - DIP Report.docx
